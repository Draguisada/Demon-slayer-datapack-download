=   THIS DATAPACK DON'T CONTAIN SPOILERS FROM THE MANGA!    =

= HOW TO INSTALL=

Just install the last version of the datapack, it's going to download a .zip file that you neew to extract
The .zip file contains the Texture pack and the datapack, Both for the last version of minecraft

= OBS=

If you want to try this datapack in a server or a survival world DO NOT INSTALL THE < 0.2, These versions are horrible optimized and the working nichirin in this version gonna stop working, if you want to check out create a backup or go in a creative world, the 0.3 Version gonna be more optimized and gonna change everything!

= DISCLAIMER =
SO, I'M REWRITIN THE WHOLE ELEMENT PART OF THE DATAPACK, now you're gonna need a nichirin-tou then (i'm chosing) or you get a random element or you select, so this gonna take hole lot of time.
